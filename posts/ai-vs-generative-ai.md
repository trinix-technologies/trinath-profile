## 🧠 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence refers to the **broad field of computer science** focused on building systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

### Core Capabilities of AI:

- Learning from data (Machine Learning)
- Decision-making (Rule-based systems, Reinforcement Learning)
- Perception (Vision, Speech Recognition)
- Language Understanding (NLP)

📌 **Goal:** Mimic or augment human intelligence to automate tasks.

**Examples:**

- Google Maps recommending routes
- Email spam filters
- Fraud detection in banks
- Siri/Alexa responding to commands

## 🎨 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a **subset of AI** focused on creating new content — text, images, code, audio, video — based on patterns learned from existing data.

It uses **generative models** like:

- Large Language Models (LLMs): GPT, Claude, Gemini
- Diffusion models: DALL·E, Stable Diffusion
- Audio: MusicGen, ElevenLabs

📌 **Goal:** Generate novel, human-like content.

**Examples:**

- ChatGPT writing an email or code
- Midjourney generating artwork from a prompt
- GitHub Copilot suggesting code

## 🧩 Summary

- **AI** is the umbrella term.
- **Generative AI** is a focused area within AI specialized in generating data.
- Not all AI is generative, but all Generative AI is a part of AI.

> 💡 Think of AI as the _brain_, and Generative AI as the _creative part_ of that brain.
